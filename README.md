Using rust to solve word searches

This is my first completed project in rust and I'm very happy about it.

You can either set the environment variables `RWORDFINDER_DICT` the location of a lexicon of words you want to find and `RWORDFINDER_WSEARCH` to
the path to the wordsearch you want solved. The wordsearch has to be rectangular. You can put cute shapes if you like with non letter characters as
boundaries to keep the desired wordsearch rectangular in shape.
